# My Blog App

## A small blog app I am creating to self-host on on home network

### Why?

Partially I am doing this as a way to keep track of my own hobbies, currently I plan to track:

* My own development progress professionally, around things like

    * Coding/software
    * Web
    * Home lab development
* My hobbies, which may include
    * Baking
    * Photography
    * Maybe more?

However the main reason is to let me develop key skills, technologies and techniques I know I want to practice. Which takes me to...

### Technical info

I plan to develop the entire app in JavaScript with

* Front end using React
* Back end using Node.js and Express

Other frameworks/tools I plan to implment include

* SASS
* AJAX
* Bootstrap

I am currently undecided on backend DB, but know it will be either MySQL or MongoDB.

The front and backend will each run as a Docker container, with my current Apache server being refactored as a reverse proxy for these containers.
